# 🗨️ Real-Time WebSocket Chat with .NET 9 (Clean Architecture + Razor Pages)

A real-time, extensible chat application built using **.NET 9**, leveraging **Clean Architecture**, **Razor Pages with MVC pattern**, and **WebSocket** for real-time communication.

This project showcases scalable backend design and now includes Docker support, along with future integration plans for AI/ML agents, JWT, RSA encryption, SignalR, and unit tests.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time **public and private** chat using **WebSockets**
- ✅ Clean Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, UI)
- ✅ Built on **.NET 9**, **Razor Pages**, **MVC pattern**
- ✅ Client registration via `/ws?clientId=xyz`
- ✅ Message routing: public or private via `@clientId`
- 🐳 Docker support for easy deployment

## 🤖 AI/ML Agent (Planned)

A built-in AI agent (e.g., `@Bot`) will:

- Automatically respond to specific queries (`@Bot what is the weather?`)
- Use local ML models or external LLM APIs
- Handle NLP and intent detection
- Integrate with external APIs (e.g., weather, time, definitions)
- Future extensibility to RAG or LangChain-style LLM agents
